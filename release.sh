# * @brief Cut a release: bump the version, build the package and publish it on GitHub
# * @date 2026-10-07
# *
# * @copyright Copyright (c) 2026
# */

# Usage:
#   ./release.sh patch|minor|major|<x.y.z> [options]
#   ./release.sh --no-bump [options]
#
#   --dry-run        print the plan and change nothing
#   --yes            do not ask before pushing and publishing
#   --no-push        stop after the tag; print the commands to push and publish by hand
#   --no-bump        release the version the manifests already carry: nothing is bumped and
#                    nothing is committed. The tag is used if it is there and created if it is
#                    not, which is what the very first release needs
#   --notes-file F   use a file as the release notes (default: GitHub generates them, listing
#                    the commits since the previous release)
#   --root DIR       release the checkout in DIR (default: the directory holding this script)
#
# Without --no-bump it does, in order: check the version → rewrite the manifests → cargo test and
# `tauri build --bundles deb` in the build container → git commit → git tag → git push → gh release
# create with the .deb attached. With --no-bump the version is left as it stands, and the tag has to
# be there.
#
# The package is built in the container from Dockerfile.release, on Jammy, so that the binary asks
# for no glibc newer than 2.35 — see that file for why.
#
# It stops instead of guessing: a dirty tree, an existing tag, a version that does not go up, or
# a `gh` that is missing or not logged in are all reasons to refuse before anything is touched.

# — inside the container from Dockerfile.release. Glibc only goes forwards, so that one package
# covers Jammy and everything newer; there is no package per distribution.
